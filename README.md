# My journey
In an effort to ABC (always be coding) I decided to start tackling all the problems codingbat has to offer. Posting my progress on here so that others can gain a new perspective on how to approach these problems and maybe learn something along the way; just like I am.

# Disclaimer
I do not condone cheating and posted my solutions for educational purposes.
